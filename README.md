# Indiana Jumps

## Introduction
This is a project made by CITM's (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimèdia) students of the TTC (Tech Talent Center) in Barcelona. We are Pol Casaú and Xavi Marin and we hope you enjoy the game.

Indiana Jumps is a platformer where you put yourself in the shoes of an adventurer, with the objective of arriving to the end of each level avoiding all the obstacles and impediments that you will find across the map.

You won't complete the levels if you bump into cactus or if you fall into the water; there are also enemies which you can kill by sliding at them, but they will follow you, so be careful while jumping through the map!
